Why is the Gates Foundation investing in TEDxChange Scholarships?
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation became a strategic partner of TEDx in 2010, with the mission of launching TEDxChange, and to bring TED programs to communities that might not otherwise have access.

As such, the Gates Foundation decided to launch a scholarship program, where they underwrite the cost of bringing TEDx event organizers to TED Conferences. For this scholarship, The Gates Foundation covers the TEDx organizers' airfare, hotel, transportation to and from the venue, and that TED Conference’s registration fee.

After a conference ends, the TEDxChange Scholarship recipients return home, ready to implement the learnings from the conference locally in an effort to grow their TEDx community. Attending an official TED Conference also gives organizers the privilege of hosting a TEDx event with more than 100 attendees, expanding the reach of TED and TEDx in their communities.
